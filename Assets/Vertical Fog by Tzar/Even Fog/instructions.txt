Even fog URP is an always flat simple fog for the Universal Render Pipeline.

Basic use:
1. Create a Plane - GameObject -> 3D Object -> Plane
2. Create a new material, drag the appropriate Vertical Fog.shader on top of the material and then apply the material to the plane/object
3. DEPTH CONTROL: Change the scale of the Y axis of the plane object to adjust the depth

If the fog breaks in your URP version, the source of the shader is included in Source folder and can be recreated within Shader Graph if necessary!
Or try using the new Standard RP EvenFog shader.
